        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>In this exploration, we have analyzed various aspects of vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency. We examined different vehicle types, compared emissions by fuel type, analyzed the relationship between fuel efficiency and horsepower, and assessed the impact of transmission types on fuel efficiency. By understanding these factors, we gain insights into how vehicles perform and how we can make more informed choices regarding vehicle efficiency and environmental impact.</p>
