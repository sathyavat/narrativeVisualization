        <h1>Fuel Efficiency by Fuel Type and Its Impact on Emissions</h1>
        <p>In this scene, we examine how fuel efficiency varies across different fuel types. This section provides insights into the performance of various fuels in terms of efficiency and also discusses their associated emissions. By analyzing these factors, we can understand how different fuel choices impact both fuel efficiency and environmental footprint.</p>
