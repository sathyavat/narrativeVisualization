        <h1>Understanding Vehicle Emissions and Efficiency in 2024</h1>
        <h2>An interactive slideshow by Sathyavat Chandran (CS 416)</h2>

        <p>In the rapidly evolving automotive industry, understanding vehicle performance and environmental impact is crucial. This interactive slideshow provides an insightful look at emissions, fuel efficiency, and test procedures for the 2024 model year vehicles. Our analysis aims to shed light on how various factors—such as vehicle make, fuel type, and engine specifications—affect emissions and efficiency.</p>
