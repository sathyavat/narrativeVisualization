    <h1>Introduction to Vehicle Efficiency Analysis: A Detailed Exploration</h1>
    <h2>Name: An interactive slideshow by Sathyavat Chandran (CS 416)</h2>

    <p>In today’s era of advanced automotive technology, understanding vehicle fuel efficiency remains a key consideration for many. Our interactive slideshow aims to offer a closer look at fuel consumption trends using a 2017 dataset. Through this exploration, we seek to shed light on how different factors—such as car make, fuel type, and engine specifications—impact miles per gallon (MPG).</p>

    <h3>Scene 1: Manufacturer Efficiency - A Comparative View of MPG by Make</h3>
    <p>We begin with an overview of fuel efficiency across various car manufacturers. Scene 1 features a bar chart that presents the average MPG for different car makes. This scene allows for a comparative look at how various brands perform in terms of fuel consumption. By toggling between city and highway MPG, you’ll be able to see a range of performance levels among different manufacturers and gain a sense of which brands are more fuel-efficient.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: Fuel Types - Examining Their Impact on MPG</h3>
    <p>Scene 2 shifts focus to fuel types, exploring how gasoline, diesel, and electric fuels affect MPG. This scene aims to highlight differences in fuel efficiency across these fuel types. By toggling between city and highway MPG, you’ll be able to see how each fuel type performs in various driving conditions. This comparison offers a practical perspective on which fuel types may provide better mileage under different scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Engine Cylinders and MPG - Understanding the Connection</h3>
    <p>In Scene 3, we investigate the relationship between engine cylinders and fuel efficiency. This scatter plot reveals how engine size influences MPG, providing insights into the balance between engine power and fuel consumption. Using the toggle buttons to view city and highway MPG, you’ll be able to see trends and correlations that offer a clearer understanding of how engine design impacts efficiency.</p>
